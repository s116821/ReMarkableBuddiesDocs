# Wait inventory and measurement contract

Source inspection on September 22, 2026. This is the baseline inventory, not a
claim that the proposed replacements or their native validation are complete.
No timing or input behavior has changed in the measurement checkpoint.

## Supported observations found in this repository

- `input_observer.rs` reads Linux input frames and checks device identity; these
  are input activity/ownership signals, not xochitl rendering acknowledgements.
- `native_page.rs` reads document/page/visit and process identity. Native history
  additionally parses persisted text and requires exact expected content. Files
  can lag visible state; a change notification alone would not establish success.
- `status_style.rs` classifies fresh toolbar pixels and verifies page identity and
  unchanged content before input. Persisted tool preferences are not UI authority.
- `openai.rs` receives the result of the one active scoped request through a
  capacity-one channel. Its worker is joined even if the progress callback fails.
  Current cancellation therefore does not promptly abort the HTTP request.
- No xochitl UI-completion subscription is implemented in the current dependency
  set or device adapters. This does not establish that no external API exists.
  Native interface investigation remains open; do not invent an event source.

Read-only RM2 inspection (firmware 3.28.0.172, xochitl PID 30974) found two unique
system D-Bus connections for xochitl and no well-known xochitl UI service name.
Bounded five-second introspection of each root returned `Access denied`. No
objects/signals were discovered. Do not change bus policy or bypass that denial.
Thus no usable supported UI completion subscription has been established on this
tablet; fresh pixels plus existing owner/session observations are the available
fallback. This is evidence of this inspection's limit, not proof of global API
absence. No tablet configuration or service state was changed by inspection.

## Current waits and next verification

| Caller / baseline wait | Actual required completion | Decision / remaining evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main.rs`, 1000ms after device construction | Virtual input devices usable by the application | `Keyboard::owned_sysfs` establishes registration only. Investigate input readiness; keep this one-time wait unchanged until consumer readiness or a justified exception is established. |
| `xochitl_integration.rs`, baseline500ms after swipe; orchestrator/navigation, another800ms | Correct destination, same document/session, fresh page and positive chrome | VerifiedRM2 candidate now resolves native neighbor/order before one swipe and polls fresh bracketed target metadata/pixels with5s deadline/50ms pacing. Requires source-image difference, clear footer/gutter and2matching frames; composite evidence, not a render acknowledgement. Old500ms remains only on unsupported fallback; caller800ms remains pending native validation despite explicit completion result. Identical pages/occupied gutter conservatively refuse. Native acceptance pending. |
| `Workflow::is_valid_answer_page`, 500ms | Settled, eligible answer page | Fresh capture plus blank/header predicate is available; correlate to requested destination. Repeated identical captures alone cannot establish that navigation occurred. |
| Orchestrator header save, 500ms | Complete header rendered before taking reference | Native exact persisted header is available on the verified RM2 contract but lags rendering. Require fresh visible header verification too; unsupported hardware needs an explicit safe fallback. |
| `RealDevice::press`, baseline250ms contact +100ms after release | Recognized tap, then requested toolbar state | Contact duration retained as a physical-input candidate exception, not a measured minimum. The post-release100ms is now replaced by verified polling. Release-on-error and journal-before-input remain. Native validation pending. |
| `Lease::transition`, baseline five captures | Exact slot/menu/grid/color/width predicate under unchanged owner/content | Now five-second monotonic deadline with50ms pacing and cancellation around fresh observations. Exactly one press; late successful capture refuses. All-input observer begins after owned touch release because injection shares the physical source; cancellation latches status input off. No claim of input attribution during the contact. Deterministic immediate/delayed/repeated-pending/lost/late/owner/cancel checks use this production transition. Native availability/performance pending. |
| `RealDevice::status_clear`, 100ms after erasure | Owned marks gone, surrounding content and original style preserved | Use bounded fresh cleanup evidence and existing final lease proof. Empty corner alone is not full restoration. |
| `NativeHistory::settled`, 100ms polling, 30s deadline, three equal readings | Complete expected parsed content under owner/session/input guards | Existing bounded polling, not a fixed completion assumption. Check deadline after expensive observations too; preserve external-input cancellation and exact content. Persisted latency and visible latency are separate. |
| `NativeHistory::wait`, 10ms polling | Input reducer emits qualified action or invalidation | Legitimate polling cadence; investigate descriptor readiness only if measured relevant. Preserve contact state across invalidation and timeouts. |
| `OpenAI::execute_with_progress`, channel receive timeout at indicator cadence | Result for active request or failure | Existing real completion event. Serialized progress callback can postpone consumption; measure HTTP span separately from callback/join wait. A failed callback must never allow late provider success to resume device input. |
| Indicator deadline, 333ms stages/auxiliary | Feedback animation cadence | Intentional cadence, not readiness proof. Keep visible-feedback measurement separate from menu work and input-write timestamps. |
| Swipe 50ms initial contact + 15 x 10ms steps | Recognizable continuous gesture | Physical gesture candidate exception; baseline retained, no claim these are minimums. |
| Keyboard sync/key stages 1/10ms, extra caret composition 50ms | Complete characters including native dead-key behavior | Input pacing with known caret correctness evidence from prior native work. Multiple waits mean roughly 40ms per ordinary character, not the historical inventory's 10ms. No blind reduction. Verify exact persisted and visible output with fixed text length. |
| History keyboard 50ms pacing / 60s deadline | Owned, bounded edit command | Keep ownership checks and native complete-content verification; do not replace with status activity. |
| Pen/touch 1/5/10ms event/row/path waits; trigger tap 100ms | Recognized strokes/contact sequences | Physical-input candidates, not measured hardware minimums. Keep until separately validated. |
| Reader hold 2s and history contact qualification | Intentional gesture qualification | Preserve; report separately from trigger-release-to-feedback. |

The historical 200ms body-mode waits are absent in the current orchestrator.
Do not report savings against removed code. Each remaining fixed-wait candidate
needs native validation before being called a necessary exception. No Paper Pro
native timing evidence is available.

## Measurement events

### First capture cost change
The nearest resize now copies the exact selected eight-bit channels directly,
using the same f32 center/floor/clamp sampling as image0.25.10's zero-support
Nearest kernel. Pixel-for-pixel comparison against the library covers normalized
native RM2 dimensions (modern and rotated legacy), Paper Pro dimensions, gray
levels, RGBA/alpha, upscaling and equal dimensions; invalid formats/empty images
refuse. Raw conversion/orientation, both PNG encodes, allocation discovery and
owner guards remain unchanged in this incremental step. No native speedup is
claimed from source checks alone; baseline.md records the subsequent three native
captures and their limits. The next owned-image implementation removes the second
native conversion/encode/decode from workflow capture and all PNG round trips
from status observation. Conversion and native serialization now have separate
spans. The old codec path remains a test-only oracle; full native integration and
repeated performance acceptance remain open.

Debug logs emit fixed `timing` fields: process ID, run ID, operation ID, phase,
begin/end, monotonic microseconds and elapsed microseconds. An iteration gets a
new run; the existing provider worker explicitly inherits it. Run zero denotes
operations outside an iteration (for example screenshot diagnostics). IDs are
local to one process; retain the source revision, binary hash and launch log with
every run. No prompt, key, endpoint, image, document ID or answer text is added by
these timing events. Existing non-timing logs may contain document/model content;
inspect them before publication. Logging remains controlled by existing levels.

Events stream to the configured logger without an in-memory history or new
background process. Each instrumented call emits two records. An end event means
the scope ended, including error or panic; it is NOT a success assertion. Pair by
process/run/operation and preserve incomplete spans if a process is killed.
Counts are counts of begin records, not begin plus end. Nested and overlapping
spans must not be summed as independent latency. Provider request time overlaps
status callbacks, and `provider.wait_with_progress` includes join/callback cost.

`capture.native_png` currently includes raw conversion and serialization, twice
per full capture, with `capture.raw_conversion` and `capture.native_serialize`
subspans; Paper Pro already supplies RGBA bytes so has no raw conversion span.
`capture.overview` includes the second native PNG, decode,
resize and overview encode subspans. `status.observe`
includes owner bracketing, screenshot, decode, metadata and classification input;
`status.acquire/cleanup/restore` include their nested observations. Sum all actual
leases per iteration but don't double-count their inner spans.

`reader.active` starts after trigger dispatch/iteration setup (or before immediate capture)
and ends when the inner workflow returns; `reader.iteration` also includes outer
cleanup and may include trigger waiting.
Historical `reader.trigger_dismiss` began after observing the qualified trigger,
before the dismissing tap. Integration50cb909 removed that tap and its span;
dbf5609 restores conditional dismissal and a separate short-scoped
`reader.trigger_release_observed` marker before dismissal work. The failed native
sample580.393ms does not establish successful dismissal or full-workflow latency. Any
software observation includes input-poll lag, not a hardware release timestamp.
These are host monotonic timestamps, not simulated elapsed time or a claim of
first/last visible pixels. Rendering
logs include character count only. Bounded visible observation, logging overhead,
successful/error labels and repeated native baseline remain required.

Exact internal rejected-frame dumping already exists behind the resolved
`--debug-dump` setting in the normal executable; the immediate `reader_once`
example intentionally disables it. For refusal investigation use the normal
bounded loop with opt-in dumping and preserve both images after each attempt.
Do not substitute external pre-attempt screenshots for the internal pair.

## Menu and drawing audit (2026-09-23 UTC)

- Integration50cb909 makes `RealDevice::status_style_begin/end/clear` use V3
  current-tool leases exclusively. Native `StyleIo::press` refuses without input;
  historical V2 parsing/tests remain but no normal native acquisition reaches them.
  Input continuity covers the active lease; prelease readiness uses a separate
  scoped observer, and is not continuous observation from the trigger.
- `Workflow::draw_failure` obtains the same style lease before its three generic
  lines. Success indicator paths use status_stroke. Both must share new eligibility.
- `draw_symbol`, `erase_region`, `erase_region_smart`, Pen bitmap/rectangle helpers
  have no normal src callers beyond their public wrappers; do not introduce uses
  without current-tool/footprint review. Diagnostic examples require separate audit.
- `status_clear` emits physical BTN_TOOL_RUBBER along owned paths, not menu input.
  Pressure is2630; actual maximum-width and eraser envelopes still require proof.
- `body_mode` is Cmd3 keyboard input; answer/header rendering is keyboard input.
  Next/Previous are horizontal swipes. These are not autonomous menu navigation.
- Integration50cb909's no-tap proposal failed natively because the overflow panel
  remained open. Candidate dbf5609 permits one known-panel outside tap, with100ms
  physical contact, positive owned-touch release, fresh postconditions and5s
  total deadline/50ms known-open pacing. Native delivery was verified, but its
  post-tap capture failed on a vanished allocation candidate. No successful
  trigger/capture/navigation or latency acceptance is claimed. Task4.9 plans
  bounded read-only capture recovery; it is not implemented at this checkpoint.
- The100ms post-erase physical-settling exception remains before positive corner
  and final lease verification. Current evidence does not establish its minimum
  or replace it with an authoritative completion event.

## Targeted community evidence (2026-09-23 UTC)

Roadblock: current-tool properties cannot all be proven from closed toolbar pixels.
Inspected upstream inkling commit089efb2c9f24ce64127c6fc4d7fd30f93ae5ad94,
[xovi bridge source](https://github.com/nathanmarlor/inkling/blob/089efb2c9f24ce64127c6fc4d7fd30f93ae5ad94/xovi-ext/inklingfb/main.c#L616).
It accesses DocumentView.penHandler on the GUI thread, writes lineTool,
gestureMode and lineThickness, and separately restores selectedButton. Thus it is
a real non-coordinate approach, but a process-injected Qt bridge, not an external
supported vendor API. Its own documentation records crash/threading constraints;
we have not established firmware3.28.0.172 compatibility or full style restoration.
The sampled repository has no releases and its listed PR concerns a provider,
not compatibility. No bridge installed or process patched.

Also inspected alefaraci/xovi-qmd-extensions commit0817207c6345f198d5cafeca5cd278deba2cae0b:
[3.28 gesture source](https://github.com/alefaraci/xovi-qmd-extensions/blob/0817207c6345f198d5cafeca5cd278deba2cae0b/3.28/gestik.qmd)
and [3.27 toolbar readout](https://github.com/alefaraci/xovi-qmd-extensions/blob/0817207c6345f198d5cafeca5cd278deba2cae0b/3.27/toolbarTool.qmd).
These are versioned QML modifications requiring rm-xovi-extensions; the tree has
3.28 gestures but no corresponding3.28 toolbarTool file. The sole listed release
contains dictionary data, not a verified tool-control compatibility release.
This establishes promising internal mechanisms, not a safe drop-in dependency.

Decision for this bounded pass: retain these alternatives for review; continue
stock current-tool eligibility/footprint validation without invasive installation.
If closed-toolbar coverage is too narrow for acceptance, compare the bridge cost
and compatibility explicitly rather than silently accepting universal suppression
or claiming no alternative exists. No upstream source copied into product code.
